### Proof of Concept for a Django Project with SQLite
The goal of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to build a simple, functional Django application that demonstrates the basic features and workflows you'd expect in a web project, using SQLite as the database. SQLite is a great choice for this because it's lightweight, easy to set up, and perfect for smaller projects or quick prototypes.
#### Getting Started
First, we'll set up a new Django project and create a sample app within it. Django comes with SQLite as its default database, which makes our setup process straightforward—no need to install or configure a separate database server.
#### Key Features
In this PoC, we’ll focus on a few essential features:
- **Data Models**: We'll create basic models to represent our data, such as a `User` model for handling authentication and maybe a `Product` model if we're thinking about building something like a small store.
- **Migrations**: Django’s migration system will help us set up the database structure based on our models. This part is crucial as it allows us to evolve the database schema as the project grows.
- **Views and Templates**: We'll write a few simple views to handle requests and display data. These views will be connected to HTML templates that render the data for the user.
- **Forms and Validation**: We'll set up forms to handle user input, making sure that any data submitted by users is clean and valid.
- **Routing**: By setting up URL patterns, we’ll ensure that different parts of our app are accessible through clean, user-friendly URLs.
- **Admin Interface**: Django’s built-in admin interface is a powerful tool. We'll use it to manage our models without having to write any additional code for data management.
#### Testing the Waters
To make sure everything works as expected, we’ll write a few tests. These will check that our models, views, and forms behave correctly, giving us confidence that our app is on the right track.
#### Wrapping Up
For deployment, since this is just a PoC, we can keep it simple—perhaps running it locally or deploying it on a platform like Heroku. We’ll stick with SQLite in development mode because it’s easy and fits our current needs.
#### Conclusion
This PoC serves as a solid foundation for a Django project, showing off how quickly you can get something functional up and running. As the project grows, we might consider switching to a more powerful database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, but for now, SQLite has us covered.
